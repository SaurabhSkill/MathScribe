# 📝 Handwritten Equation Solver

> Predict and solve handwritten mathematical equations from an image using OCR and AI.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This application can recognize and solve handwritten equations involving:

- Basic arithmetic: ➕ Addition, ➖ Subtraction, ✖️ Multiplication, ➗ Division  
- Algebraic expressions: Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, and higher-degree equations

It uses:
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** for image preprocessing and character segmentation
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** for handwritten character prediction

---

## 📷 Example Use Case

Upload an image containing a handwritten equation like:


The system will:
1. Predict the characters using CNN
2. Parse the equation
3. Solve and return the answer:  
> `x = 2`
